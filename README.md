## Setup and Usage

**Note:** This guide assumes you have Python and MySQL installed on your system. You do **not** need to create a virtual environment if you want to skip it.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HimaHarika282/Urban-Nexus.git
cd Urban-Nexus
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
->Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Database Setup

->Make sure MySQL server is running.
->Create the database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE smartcity_db;
```
->Update database credentials in app.py and citizen/route.py if needed:

```python
user="root"
password="your_mysql_password"
host="127.0.0.1"
database="smartcity_db"
```
->Create tables manually using models.py or allow your app to create tables automatically (for some ORM setups).

### 4.Running the Application
Start the Flask server:
    ``` python
    python app.py
    ```
  
 ->Open your browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
  
 ->Homepage will load.
  
 ->Citizens can register and login to use the portal.
  
 ->Authority members can login using their credentials.**
  

## Usage Guide

  **Citizen Portal**
  
  Signup: Fill in name, date of birth, email, phone, address, zone, password.
  
  Profile: Update details and upload avatar.
  
  Service Requests: Submit requests for utilities, view past requests.
  
  Emergency Requests: Submit requests for police, fire, or hospital.
  
  Bills: View electricity and gas bills, make payments.
  
  Property Management: List properties for sale or view availability.
  

  **Authority Portal**
  
  Login: Use staff ID and department to login.
  
  Dashboard: View requests assigned to your department and manage statuses.

## Notes

  The project uses MySQL for storing all citizen and authority data.
  
  Uploaded avatars and other files are stored in citizen/static/uploads.
  
  Make sure the MySQL database is accessible and credentials are correctly set in app.py.
  
  All information entered by users is saved directly to the database.
  
  No virtual environment is required, but using one is recommended for Python dependency management in real deployments.
  

## Future Improvements

- Deploy the project on a cloud platform with live database access.
- Add automated email notifications for requests.
- Enhance security (HTTPS, CSRF protection, input validation).
- Mobile-friendly responsive design.
